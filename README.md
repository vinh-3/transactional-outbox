# Transactional Outbox Pattern
The transactional outbox is an architectural pattern that is used to reliably send events associated with database 
updates. This pattern guarantees an **at-least-once** delivery of event messages.

For more information [see](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html).

This repository is an example of how this pattern can be applied to a simple CRUD service for storing information about books.
